This is a life counter for the card game MTG.

To understand every detail it might be useful to have played a few games of
the card game, especially the Commander format, but the basics are that this
can be used to count life points and various different counters during a game
of magic.

===============================================================================
When launched you are presented with a menu, which comes with 3 preset modes
for counting life:
* Commander 4p:
    This sets up a 4 player game for the Commander format with a starting life
    total of 40 life points.
    Each player gets their own number/square on the screen with which they can
    track their life total, commander damage and their counters.

* Commander 1p (3 opponents):
    This sets up a 4 player game for the Commander format with a starting life
    total of 40 life points.
    In this mode only the player using the life counter gets a number (but a
    huge one) on screen with the corresponding commander damage and counters,
    the remaining players (opponents) will have to track their life total
    separately.

* 1v1:
    This sets up a 1 vs 1 game for a 2 player format with a starting life total
    of 20.
    The 2 players each get one number for tracking their life total.
    Commander damage is not visible in this mode, but the counters are.

Or if these modes are not suitable, it is possible to define a life total
manually (in steps of 5) as well as a player count.
If the player count equals 1 (the minimum) a separate option for the amount
of opponents will be shown. This is used to set how many commander damage
numbers should be visible (see also "Commander 1p (3 opponents)"). If the
number of opponents is set to 0 commander damage is omitted (see also
"1v1").

When there are more than 4 players, the life total will be shown as simple
text lines instead of using large/huge numbers due to the limited screen space.
When one of the players has a life total of less than -99 or more than 999, the
screen will also change to this limited mode.

There are options to change the current song (via LEFT/RIGHT when selected) and
for loading a save or autosave file.

The "Load save" entry will load manually saved states.
The "Load autosave" entry will load automatically saved state.

NOTE about the autosave file:
When a game has been started, states will be automatically saved after 15
seconds when a change has occured, while resetting to 15 seconds each time
another change has occured to avoid saving unecessarily/constantly.
This is indicated on the bottom of the screen.

The "Show controls" entry shows some details about how to use the counters when
a game has been started.

===============================================================================
When a game has been started use the UP/DOWN buttons to change the life total
of the currently selected player (which is indicated via a DOT next to the life
total.
The selected player can be changed via the SELECT button.
The LEFT/RIGHT buttons will change the currently selected commander damage or
poison/energy/experience/commander-tax counter.
The selected commander damage or counter can be changed via the L/R buttons.

The counters are indicated via a letter before the counter value:
P = Poison
E = Energy
X = Experience
C = Commander Tax

When the life total is changed a number will appear on screen in the same color
as the currently selected player, indicating how much the life total has
changed, useful to correct mistakes. This number is reset and disappears after
3 seconds.

When the life total drops to 0 a deaths sound effect will be played and the
player will be drawn in red (unless selected). The same applies when the
amount of poison counters changes to 10.

===============================================================================
When the in game menu is accessed you are presented with a few menu items for
saving/quitting/returning to the game/changing songs and showing controls, as
well as, in case the game is a game with at least 2 and at most 4 players, a
menu entry "Flip top numbers". This menu entry is useful in e.g. a game of
commander where some of the people sit on the opposite side of the table.
Selecting this will draw the player 1 and player 2 numbers upside down (as
well as the corresponding commander damage and counters) such that they can be
easily read by players across the table. It also inverts the button/dpad
behaviour such that the GBA does not need to be rotated when performing inputs.
